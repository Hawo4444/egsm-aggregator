    <!-- Defining Process groups which can be used later to specify monitoring tasks
    The two main types of groups are: static and dynamic
    -static: The members are defined at the time of instantiation, no further process adding or removing is possible
    -dynamic: The members are not defined at the time of instantiation, only membership rules are defined and the update
    of memberships will be updated in runtime-->
