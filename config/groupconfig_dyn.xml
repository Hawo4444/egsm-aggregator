    <!-- Defining Process groups which can be used later to specify monitoring tasks
    The two main types of groups are: static and dynamic
    -static: The members are defined at the time of instantiation, no further process adding or removing is possible
    -dynamic: The members are not defined at the time of instantiation, only membership rules are defined and the update
    of memberships will be updated in runtime. However 'Static' memberships cannot be defined in this case, so a process
    will be member only if it was created AFTER the definition of the group and if the process instance meets the membership
    requirements  -->
